  Working in frontend development for 20 years. Currently spending most of my time in React Native, React and TypeScript
  to build enterprise-level reliable, maintainable and scalable mobile apps and web apps. I have worked with many big
  brands and a long list of CRMs, CMSs, APIs, platforms, proxies and protocols.

  A believer in creating apps that can handle user experiences of increasing complexity, thinking in systems, and
  investing in tooling that helps dev teams grow together.
